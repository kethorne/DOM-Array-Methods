#  Project Name
DOM Array Methods

# Project Description
Javascript project that uses different array methods, using data returned 
from an API (https://randomuser.me/api) and displaying the data.

# Why I Built It
Practice calling an API and utilizing the information returned from the API. 
Using async and await instead of promises.

# What I Would Do Next
I would add some additional information such as what country they live in 
and their job title.

# What I Learned
I learned to add more detail to my comments for later reference and/or
anyone looking at my code. I need more work on objects and arrays, especially 
those that are nested. I need to break down my code into smaller steps.

# Stack Information
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla Javascript
* JSON
* Fetch
* Asyn
* Await 

# How To Use It
Each button performs a different task. You can add a user, double each 
user's money, sort the users by the richest one, show only those users who 
are millionaiers and total the wealth of all the users.
